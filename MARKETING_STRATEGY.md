# MeetingPrep AI - Marketing Strategy

## 🎯 LinkedIn Content Marketing

### **Challenge: Brand Separation**
- User already has existing business on LinkedIn
- Posting about new product could appear as "jumping between ideas"
- Need targeted approach without confusing existing audience

### **Solution: Targeted LinkedIn Strategies**

#### **1. LinkedIn Newsletter (Recommended)**
- Create separate newsletter: "Meeting Efficiency Weekly"
- Opt-in subscribers only (no spam to main followers)
- Build targeted audience interested in meeting prep
- Professional way to establish expertise

#### **2. LinkedIn Groups Targeting**
- Join sales/meeting-focused groups:
  - Sales Navigator Users
  - Revenue Operations Professionals
  - Business Development Networks
  - Account Executive Communities
- Post in groups instead of main feed
- Targets interested audience without broadcasting to all followers

#### **3. Direct Messaging Campaigns**
- Use LinkedIn Sales Navigator
- Target: Sales Managers, Account Executives, Business Development
- Personalized messages about meeting prep challenges
- Higher conversion rates than public posts

#### **4. LinkedIn Ads (Micro-Budget: £20-50/month)**
- Sponsored content targeting specific job titles
- Only shows to target audience
- Doesn't appear as personal content
- Test messaging before organic rollout

#### **5. Content Segmentation**
- **Main feed:** Continue existing business content
- **Comments:** Engage in meeting/productivity discussions
- **Articles:** Write about meeting efficiency (without mentioning tool initially)
- **Stories:** MeetingPrep content (24hr expiration)

### **Brand Positioning Options**
- **Stealth Launch:** Share as "interesting tool I found"
- **Portfolio Approach:** Position as serial problem-solver
- **Separate Company Page:** MeetingPrep AI company page with own followers
