# Email to Existing MeetingPrep AI Users

## How to Send:

You need to get the emails from your Supabase database:
```bash
cd C:\meeting-prep-AI\meeting-prep-landing
node get-user-emails.js
```

Then send this email to each user individually (or BCC them all).

Hey there,

Connor here - I built MeetingPrep AI (the Chrome extension you installed).

Quick question: **have you actually used it yet?**

I'm asking because I noticed most people install it but never click the icon to generate their first brief.  If that's you, no worries! Here's how to use it in 30 seconds:

**3 Quick Steps:**

1. **Pin the extension** - Click the puzzle piece icon (🧩) in Chrome → Find "MeetingPrep AI" → Click the pin

2. **Go to Google Calendar** - https://calendar.google.com

3. **Click a meeting, then click MeetingPrep AI** - Click on any upcoming meeting in your calendar to view it, then click the MeetingPrep AI icon. It'll generate an AI brief for that meeting in 30 seconds

**What you'll get:**
- AI-generated talking points
- Attendee background info  
- Meeting prep recommendations
- Saves you 20-30 min of research per meeting

**It's free** (20 briefs/month included).

If you've already tried it, I'd love to hear your honest feedback - what worked, what didn't, what would make it more useful?

And if you hit any issues, just reply to this email and I'll help you out.

Thanks!

P.S. - If this isn't useful for you, no hard feelings! You can uninstall it anytime.
