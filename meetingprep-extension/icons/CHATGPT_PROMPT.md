**Prompt:**

Create 3 PNG icons for a Chrome browser extension called "MeetingPrep AI". The extension helps professionals prepare for meetings by generating AI-powered briefs from Google Calendar events.

**Requirements:**
- Create 3 versions: 16x16 pixels, 48x48 pixels, and 128x128 pixels
- Use a modern, professional design with a purple/blue gradient background (similar to #667eea to #764ba2)
- Include a visual element that represents meeting preparation - could be:
  - A calendar icon with an AI sparkle or brain icon
  - A document/brief icon with a checkmark
  - A stylized "MP" or "M" letter with meeting-related elements
  - A speech bubble or document with calendar elements
- Keep the design simple and recognizable at small sizes (especially the 16x16)
- Ensure text/icons are clearly visible against the gradient background
- Professional, clean, modern aesthetic suitable for business professionals

**Style Guidelines:**
- Gradient colors: Purple (#667eea) to deep purple (#764ba2) - matching the extension's popup design
- White or light-colored icons/text for contrast
- Minimal, clean design that scales well
- Modern flat or slightly dimensional style
- No complex details that will be lost at 16x16 size

**Output:**
Please provide 3 separate PNG images with transparent backgrounds:
1. icon16.png - 16x16 pixels
2. icon48.png - 48x48 pixels  
3. icon128.png - 128x128 pixels

The design should be consistent across all three sizes, with appropriate level of detail for each resolution.
